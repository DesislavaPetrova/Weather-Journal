# Weather-Journal App

## Udacity Front end Nanodegree: Project 3

## HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

## Overview

This project creates an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Development

- The project environment was set up by installing Node.JS and all NPM (express, body-parser, cors) which were included in the server.js file.

- Then POST and GET routes were added to make sure that the data is correctly received from the server.

- API credentials were created on OpenWeatherMap Website.

- The next step was creating async functions to fetch all the weather data from OpenWeatherMap and being stored on my local server.

- A click-event was set up to update the UI dynamically.
